Africa's first climate smart API! https://msituafrica.webdigital.com/msituafrica/?draft_id=7358

Carbon Offset Demo API & Calculator 

Msitu Africa Carbon Alliance, a sprouting Kenyan non-profit fintech, is revolutionizing climate action with Africa's first climate SaaS API. Our mission is to empower businesses to significantly reduce their environmental impact by connecting them to transformative carbon offset projects across Kenya and Africa. Our innovative, easy-to-integrate API automates and streamlines ESG and CSR processes, enabling businesses to offer seamless carbon footprint calculation, offsetting, or donation options directly to their customers. This empowers consumers to take impactful climate action with a simple click. Msitu Africa supports local farmers, communities, and conservation initiatives, driving sustainable development and environmental preservation throughout the region. By creating a symbiotic ecosystem for People, Planet, and Profit to thrive, we place strong emphasis on nurturing both human and environmental well-being, ensuring a harmonious balance where communities and nature can flourish together.

This project is a Carbon Offset Calculator developed for Msitu Africa to help users calculate the carbon footprint for various activities and industries. The calculator is designed to provide a user-friendly interface where users can select an industry, input relevant data, and get the carbon offset cost along with total emissions.

The project consists of three main files:

index.html - The main HTML file that structures the web page.
styles.css - The CSS file that styles the web page.
script.js - The JavaScript file that provides the functionality for the calculator.

Detailed Steps
1. Setting Up the Project
Create a Project Folder:

Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
Create a new folder for the project. This can be done by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting or creating a new folder.
Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files:

Inside the project folder, create three files named index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
2. Writing the HTML Code
Structure the HTML:
Open index.html and add the basic HTML structure.
Include a div container to hold the form elements and the results.
Add a select element for industry selection and a div for dynamic input fields.
Include a button to trigger the calculation and a div to display the results.
Link the styles.css and script.js files to the HTML.

3. Writing the CSS Code
Style the HTML Elements:
Open styles.css and add styles to make the web page visually appealing.
Style the container, headings, form elements, and result section to create a consistent and clean layout.

4. Writing the JavaScript Code
Add Functionality to the Calculator:
Open script.js and add functions to handle industry selection, generate dynamic input fields, calculate carbon offsets, and display the results.
Use JavaScript to dynamically create input fields based on the selected industry.
Implement the logic for calculating total cost, emissions, offset cost, and grand total for each industry.
5. Running the Project
Open the index.html File:
Open index.html in your default browser by right-clicking the file in VS Code and selecting "Open with Live Server." If you don't have the Live Server extension installed, you can install it from the VS Code marketplace or open the file directly in your browser.

Project Summary
This project involves creating a carbon offset calculator that allows users to select an industry, input relevant data, and calculate the total cost, emissions, offset cost, and grand total. The calculator dynamically generates input fields based on industry selection and uses JavaScript functions to handle calculations and display results. This project serves as a demo concept for Msitu Africa's plug and play API, showcasing how the API can be used to integrate carbon footprint calculations into various applications.
